# The-Z-House Project

## What is The Z-House Project

The Z-House Project hopes to be a community-led endeavour to change the way we think about housing. The main thinking and work is built on four pillars:

1) Designing Local Houses for Local Communities
2) Buildings Houses in a Responsible Manner
3) Reducing the lifetime impact of Housing
4) The safe and responsible tear-down of Housing

The core of the project was started by [Sam Hutchings](https://www.samhutchings.co) in his 2018 [project](https://samhutchings.co/projects/z-house) and [report](https://github.com/Smutchings/The-Z-House/blob/master/Unit%208%20Report%20-%20Reduced.pdf).
